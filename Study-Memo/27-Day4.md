# B+ Tree

**non-leaf nodes**: n keys, n+1 pointers that point to nodes in the next level

**leaves**: n keys, n+1 pointers n of which point to the data and one of which points to the next leaf in sequence.

**insertion** & **deletion**(normally unimplemented) 

# Hashing

**hash function**: randomness helps

**data structure**: list+linked list, list only(density differs)

**hash family** & **universal hash family**

**complexity**: O(1)

# k-th element

median selection: O(n)
