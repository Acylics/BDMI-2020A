## 1 Data System intro

- Operations of database: Read / Learn / Modify

- Goals of data systems: store current data, optimize historical data, run batch workloads

- ER: relational model

## 2 SQL

### 2.1 Basic

- SQL: Structured Query Language
- Data Types in SQL: 
	- Characters: CHAR, VARCHAR
	- Numbers: INT, BIGINT,...
	- Others: MONEY, DATETIME
- Table Schemas: name, attribute, type
- Key: unique, underlined, minimal subset of attribute to identify an element.
- SQL Query: SELECT<attributes> FROM<relation> WHERE<condition>
- SQL commands are case insensitive, while values are not. Use ‘ ’ for constants but not “ ”.
- LIKE: string matching %: any sequences; _: single character
- DISTINCT: deduplicate (SELECT DISTINCT)
- ORDER BY: Sorting the results.
- Foreign Key constraints: declared by FOREIGN KEY 

### 2.2 Advanced

- JOIN: combine two tables. INNER JOIN: 取两表的交集. OUTER JOIN: LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN
- UNION: union with deduplication; UNION ALL: no deduplication
- Nested queries: 嵌套查询
- Aggregation: functions include SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX, MIN, AVG; COUNT applies to duplicate, unless DISTINCT is added.
- GROUP BY: classified by deduplicated attributes, after which HAVING can be applied to select certain attributes.
