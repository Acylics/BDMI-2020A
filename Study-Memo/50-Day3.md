# Lecture 3 memo
In this third lecture, we learned in more details about:
- Comparison based Sorting algorithm such as quicksort and mergesort (with the constraint of miminum complexity of nlog(n)), useful for large pools of data
- Bucketsort and radixsort for more efficient sorting of small pools of datas
- Binary search tree, 2-3-4 tree, and the most efficient version: LLRB (red-black) tree
