# Lecture 4

We learned about:
- Median & selection alogrithm has a lower complexity than mergesort but might have a slower runtime depending on the constant in front of n
- 2-3-4 tree: balanced, no 4 nodes under 4 nodes
- B+tree: for indexing large pool of data, balanced, unlimited keys and low levels
- Hashing: optimal way is to select a random hashing method from universal hashing family
